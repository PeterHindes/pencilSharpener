# pencilSharpener
A python script that takes pencil sketches and turns them monochrome and removes fireflies. The output is intended to be used with inkscape or other vector tracing software to convert your pencil sketch to an svg vector graphic.

potential improvements include a smoothing algorythm for the rought edges generated by this program. inkscape does a good job, but the results are still not the best. Pull requests welcome.
